Performance improvement by drawing only changed tiles

convert weapons/items display and keycards to bit-map graphics (I can help with this)

use 4 freed-up sprites to represent units 28 - 31 which can be weapons fire, bombs, small explosion, or magnet.  

replace title screen with bit-mapped graphic

redesign the parts of the game screen that used to be character graphics into something bitmapped (I can do this)

Work out some form of animation for water, air conditioner, etc

I need to find more places where text is supposed to be drawn and fix it up to draw on the bitmap. For example, the win/lose screen has practically no information on it at the moment.

*** DONE *** redesign player character so that it contrasts better with new graphics (I can do this)

*** DONE *** It still might be useful to see where goat tracker can relocate the music to, so that we can reclaim a VIC bank in ram block 0. Starting at $9000 instead of $A000 would probably be ideal if it is possible.
